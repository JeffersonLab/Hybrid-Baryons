Generator is exclusive and electroproduction (but at low Q2 it uses photoproduction data as limiting point). It works for all Q2 starting from very small (0.005 GeV^2) and W from the threshold to 3 GeV.

The generator works in the following way: firstly, it generates phase space (flat) distributions and then for each event multidimentional cross section is applied as a weight. 

The generator produces output in lund format with minor changes:  in the Header in field 6* instead of "x" I put event number, and in field 10* instead of "nu" I put the cross section value.  (see also this slide https://clasweb.jlab.org/wiki/images/d/dc/Hybrid_Jan15_2016.pdf )

The generator also makes .BOS output that is compatible with CLAS6 reconstruction procedure and .root output with some histograms for test purposes. 

The generator includes radiative effects according to Mo&Tsai. It also includes fermi-smearing if needed.

--------------------------------------------------
The code includes rather big amount of files, but the major part of them corresponds to the interpolation/extrapolation procedures for the cross section calculation (all files with names get_xsect* and interpol*).

The key files are:

main_prog.cxx - the main program.

inp_file_read.cxx - reading information from the input file

read_xsect_files.cxx - reading files with cross sections from the corresponding directories 

out_file_open.cxx, out_file_write.cxx, out_file_close.cxx - needed to open write and close output files correspondingly.

anti_rot.cxx - contains the subroutine that calculates the 4-vectors of all final particles in the lab frame from  W, Q2 and hadron variables generated in the CMS.

rot.cxx - contains the subroutine that calculates hadron variables in the CMS from their 4-vectors in the lab frame.

radcorr.cxx - performs radiative effects.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
It should compile on the ifarms.

to run it type ./genev_clas12 < inp1

inp1 is in the same directory and contains input parameters with comments. 

--------------------------------------------------
The generator also includes subdirectories that contain cross section files and fit parameters that are needed to EG to work.
